2007-10-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-item.{c,h}: Add support for the "Path" 
	  key of the .desktop entries. This makes it possible to start
	  menu items in a special working directory. Will make fixing
	  bug #3472 easier.

2007-10-20	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-monitor.c: No, let's do it 
	  differently: You can now redefine the vtable. You can also
	  clear it by passing NULL. Whenever you want to change the
	  user_data, just pass the same vtable as before.
	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-item-cache.c: Deactivate the cache
	  for now. Perhaps we can add it later, together with fast
	  checksum support to detect filesystem changes.
	
2007-10-20	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-monitor.c: Add vtable != NULL check
	  to xfce_menu_monitor_set_vtable. Avoids crashes when passing
	  a NULL pointer and makes other developers aware of what they
	  might be doing wrong.

2007-10-12	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* STATUS: Updated the status file to reflect the
	  current implementation status.

2007-09-25	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-layout.c: As a follow-up to 
	  the last commit, fix the disabled code. There is no
	  parameter named 'layout'.

2007-09-25	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-layout.c: Fix bug #3568 which
	  was caused by the layout variable not being used in
	  _set_property and _get_property. Thanks to Tomasz Mon
	  for the hint.

2007-09-20	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-monitor.c: Use g_str_hash and 
	  g_str_equal for the file/directory to monitor handle
	  hash table, rather than comparing the pointers directly.
	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu.c: Create submenu monitors after 
	  parsing by traversing the XfceMenu tree but remove them 
	  in xfce_menu_finalize (so creating the monitors happens
	  in the root menu, removing is handled inside the 
	  submenus). Now all monitors are properly removed when
	  the root menu is destroyed.
	* tests/test-display-root-menu.c: Print the pseudo monitor 
	  handle ID in monitor_file and monitor_directory.

2007-09-20	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-monitor.{c,h}: Added methods to 
	  monitor files and directories. That way we can now add 
	  monitors for the main menu file as well as menu .directory 
	  files and the application directories - I think that's
	  all we need. Since there may be several XfceMenu's monotoring
	  the same application directories and menu files, those
	  are managed using a reference counting mechanism, so that
	  the monitor is only removed when all menus have asked
	  to remove the monitor on them.
	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu.c: Monitor the main menu file as
	  well as .directory files and application directories. And
	  of course remove the monitors when the menu is destroyed.

2007-05-22	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/Makefile.am: Fix typo.

2007-05-20	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Disable empty AC_CHECK_FUNCS([]) call for
	  now. Fixes syntax error on IRIX (bug #3251, reported by
	  Daichi).

2007-03-25	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-monitor.c: Use if statement
	  rather than g_return_(val_)if_fail to check whether vtable 
	  functions have been set.

2007-03-25	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu.c: Fix weird typo as noted by
	  Jens Luedicke.

2007-03-24	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/Makefile.am, libxfce4menu/xfce-menu.c, 
	  libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-monitor.{c,h}: Add monitoring support
	  by making it possible for library clients to define a vtable
	  with functions to be called whenever monitoring a file or
	  directory becomes necessary. This way Thunar and xfdesktop
	  can use ThunarVFS for monitoring and I don't need to care
	  about how they do it. Note: xfce_menu_monitor_notify_change()
	  is missing but will be adedd as soon as possible.
	  Add a missing NULL to g_strjoin() in xfce-menu.c as reported
	  by Jens Luedicke.
	* tests/test-display-menu.c: Add some dummy code for testing
	  the monitoring system.
	* docs/reference/: Updated and reorganized API docs.

2007-03-23	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/*.c: Remove gettext calls for strings
	  we don't really need to translate. Add gettext calls
	  were it makes sense. Remove several debug messages.

2007-03-23	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/libxfce4menu.h, libxfce4menu/Makefile.am, 
	  libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-element.{c,h}: XfceMenuElement 
	  interface with methods xfce_menu_element_get_name() and 
	  xfce_menu_element_get_icon_name() added. 
	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu.c, libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-item.c, 
	  libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-separator.c: Add XfceMenuElementIface
	  to XfceMenu, XfceMenuItem and XfceMenuSeparator. Rename
	  xfce_menu_get_layout_items() to 
	  xfce_menu_get_layout_elements().
	* tests/test-display-menu.c: Use XfceMenuElement methods
	  where possible.

2007-03-23	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/test-display-menu.c: Test program
	  for displaying a menu added again.

2007-03-23	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* docs/reference/tmpl/: Remove tdb related files from
	  SVN. They won't be installed to the system anyway.
	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/test-menu-spec.c: Test program for
	  the menu specification test suite added again.

2007-03-23	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/libxfce4menu-0.1.pc.in: Update pkg-config
	  information to point to the new header file location.

2007-03-23	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/Makefile.am: Install header files to 
	  $includedir/xfce4/libxfce4menu-<version>/libxfce4menu/.

2007-03-23	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Move to libxfce4menu. 

2007-03-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item.{c,h}: Improve set methods a little. Add 
	  support for TryExec as requested by Brian.

2007-03-20	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.c: Fix several memory leaks, among them a huge
	  310k bomb. You don't believe me? Well, see 
	  http://rafb.net/p/WPbFZy97.html for the numbers. All
	  menus (except the root menu) were ref'd twice and thus, their
	  data never got free'd anywhere.

2007-03-19	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.c: Initialize threading before anything else - this
	  seems to be a new requirement in GLib. Initialize node_type
	  of the parse context properly. Close directory handle at the
	  end of frap_menu_collect_files_from_path() to avoid mem leaks.
	* frap-menu-item-cache.c: Disable g_object_ref() calls on new
	  menu items. They're already created with a refcount of 1 ...
	* tests/test-display-root-menu.c: Initialize FrapMenu before
	  GTK+ so that threading is initialized earlier.
	* tests/test-root-menu.c: Catch possible GErrors when calling
	  frap_menu_get_root().

2007-03-19	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.c, docs/reference/tmpl/frap-menu.sgml: Improve
	  API docs a little bit. There's soooo much more to be 
	  documented.

2007-03-19	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* docs/reference/libfrapmenu-docs.sgml: Remove the xmlns:xi
	  attribute from <book>.

2007-03-19	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in, Makefile.am, docs/: Initial import of
	  gtk-doc support. Still needs some tweaking though.

2007-03-19	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.c: Avoid sorting items and submenus twice if
	  possible in frap_menu_get_layout_items().

2007-03-19	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.{c,h}: Add frap_menu_has_layout(). Return NULL
	  from frap_menu_get_layout_nodes() if a menu has no layout.
	  Disable crappy submenu consolidation code for now as it
	  didn't preserve menu layouts.
	  Sort submenus in frap_menu_get_menus() and items in 
	  frap_menu_get_items(), so API users don't have to do this.
	* tests/test-display-root-menu.c: Update test program to be
	  in sync with the latest API changes.

2007-03-18	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item.c: Replace g_return_val_if_fail() calls in
	  frap_menu_item_new() with a less verbose if statement.

2007-03-18	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.c: Fix list returned by frap_menu_get_layout_items()
	  when no layout is used (submenus were not included).

2007-03-18	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* tests/test-display-root-menu.c: Do not skip menus without 
	  menu directory, use the menu name as display name in this 
	  case. 
	* frap-menu.c, frap-menu-layout.{c,h}: Add methods for a 
	  simplified <Menuname> support. I don't want to deal with XML 
	  attributes right now, we can add support for them later.
	  Don't return menus/items already used in the menu layout 
	  elsewhere. Sort menus/items before returning them - no need
	  for the clients to implement that by themselves anymore.
	* STATUS: Status updated.

2007-03-18	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-layout.{c,h}: FrapMenuLayout added. It only supports
	  <Filename>, <Separator> and <Merge> elements currently.
	* frap-menu-separator.{c,h}: FrapMenuSeparator added. This is a
	  singleton to be inserted into the GSList returned by 
	  frap_menu_get_layout_items() whenever a separator is required.
	* frap-menu.{c,h}: Implement parsing of <Layout>, <Separator>
	  and <Merge> elements. Add layout member to the FrapMenu struct.
	  Add method to fetch all items based on the layout: 
	  frap_menu_get_layout_items(). Call _frap_menu_separator_init()
	  in frap_menu_init() and _frap_menu_separator_shutdown() in
	  frap_menu_shutdown(). Check filename != NULL in 
	  frap_menu_new(). 
	* libfrapmenu.h: Add separator and layout to the main header.
	* tests/test-display-root-menu.c: Use 
	  frap_menu_get_layout_items() instead of frap_menu_get_items().
	* Makefile.am: Add separator and layout sources.
	* STATUS: Status updated.

2007-02-14	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* STATUS: Menu spec test suite results added.
	* tests/test-display-root-menu.c: Fix warning caused by copying
	  a string into a const gchar*.

2007-02-14	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item-cache.h: Fix typo - it's 
	  frap_menu_item_cache_get_default(), not 
	  frap_menu_item_pool_get_default().

2007-02-14	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* STATUS: <Move>, <Old> and <New> are not working yet, so mark them
	  as not implemented yet. According to the menu test suite, everything
	  is completely supported now, except moving/merging menus and menu 
	  layouts!

2007-02-14	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item.{c,h}: Don't ignore items which don't match the 
	  current desktop environment. Parse OnlyShowIn/NotShowIn and add 
	  method frap_menu_item_show_in_environment() which returns whether the 
	  item should be displayed in the defined desktop environment or not. 
	  Remove frap_menu_item_matches_environment(). Don't check for != NULL 
	  before free'ing strings (g_free won't complain anyway). 
	* frap-menu-directory.{c,h}: Don't check for != NULL before calling
	  g_free(). Add frap_menu_directory_show_in_environment() (see notes on
	  frap-menu-item.c for how it works). 
	* tests/test-display-root-menu.c: Update to the new FrapMenu API.

2007-02-13	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.c: Add frap_menu_collect_files() and 
	  frap_menu_collect_files_from_path() in order to collect potential
	  desktop entry filenames for each menu prior to resolving the menu
	  items. In these methods, desktop name collisions are handled by using
	  a (desktop-file id => absolute filename) mapping. After all filenames
	  are collected, we can simply iterate over them in order to resolve
	  the menu items. All in all, this mechanism adds some memory overhead
	  but reduces filesystem I/O at the same time.
	* ./, tdb/, tests/, tests/data/: Add better svn:ignore properties for
	  the subdirectories.

2007-02-08	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item.c: Must have accidently reverted this file before
	  commiting the last changes. Do not decrement the allocation counter
	  in frap_menu_item_unref(), so excluded items won't be moved from
	  one menu to another.

2007-02-08	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item-pool.{c,h}: Remove frap_menu_item_cache_apply_rules()
	  and frap_menu_item_cache_remove_allocated() as include/exclude rules
	  are handled differently now. Instead, add 
	  frap_menu_item_cache_apply_exclude_rule().
	* frap-menu.c: Remove frap_menu_resolve_items_from_path in favour of
	  frap_menu_resolve_items_by_rule() and
	  frap_menu_resolve_items_from_path_by_rule(), so items are only added
	  to the pool if they match one of the include rules (instead of
	  removing them later if they match no include rule). Update
	  frap_menu_resolve_items() according to this. Call
	  frap_menu_resolve_deleted() after resolving the items to preserve the
	  allocation state of items allocated by the menu. 

2007-02-06	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-directory.{c,h}: Add support for NoDisplay, Hidden and
	  partial support for OnlyShowIn/NotShowIn to menu directories. Fix
	  memory leaks when the filename of a FrapMenuDirectory is redefined
	  and the menu directory has to be reloaded (note: Hidden attributes
	  won't be recognized by the related menu after reloading).
	* frap-menu.c: Handle Hidden attribute of menu directories in 
	  frap_menu_resolve_deleted() to delete menus if necessary (gives us
	  another passed test in the fd.o test suite).
	* tests/test-menu-spec.c: Handle NoDisplay attributes of menu
	  directories when printing the menus.

2007-02-06	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item-cache.c: Also acquire mutex lock in 
	  frap_menu_item_cache_foreach() as the item cache hash table could 
	  be modified by other threads during this call otherwise.

2007-02-06	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item-cache.c: Add GMutex variable to the item cache and
	  lock the item cache in frap_menu_item_cache_lookup() which is the
	  only public function where the contents of the item cache may be
	  modified. 
	* frap-menu.c: Initialize GThread system in frap_menu_init ().

2007-02-05	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/test-menu-spec.c: Test program for
	  the fd.o menu spec test suite added.
	* frap-menu-item.{c,h}: Replce "hidden" property with "no-display" as
	  hidden desktop entries won't even be parsed. Also replace all
	  accessor functions with _get_no_display(), _set_no_display()
	  equivalents. Ignore hidden desktop entries. Don't check TryExec for
	  now (as this causes errors when testing with the fd.o menu spec
	  test suite). Let frap_menu_item_get_allocated() return gint instead
	  of gboolean as we need to check at least two states (allocation 
	  counter > 1 and > 2) in FrapMenu and FrapMenuItemPool.
	* frap-menu-item-pool.{c,h}: Implement functions for removing already
	  allocated items (for menus with <OnlyUnallocated/>). Fix several
	  issues related to <Include>/<Exclude> rules, which did not work
	  properly until now.
	* frap-menu.c: Cleanup app dir related code. Remove allocated items
	  from menus with <OnlyUnallocated/> in the second pass of
	  frap_menu_resolve_items(). Only set the menu directory if there is
	  one. Don't try to load item files not ending with .desktop.
	* tests/test-menu-item.c: Use frap_menu_item_get_no_display() instead
	  of _is_hidden().

2007-01-16	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.c: Update documentation.
	* *.c, tests/*.c: Update copyright years.

2007-01-16	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-environment.{c,h}, libfrapmenu.h, Makefile.am: Add 
	  functions for defining the name of the desktop environment in 
	  order to ignore menu items belonging to other environments.
	* frap-menu.{c,h}: Add desktop environment name parameter to
	  frap_menu_init().
	* tests/*.c: Sync with new API.
	* frap-menu-item.c: Add frap_menu_item_rc_matches_environment() to check
	  whether a desktop file should be displayed in the current environment
	  or not. Call this method in frap_menu_new() before anything else is
	  parsed.

2007-01-15	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item.c: Free TryExec argument list. Remove old code. Don't
	  copy the Exec string unnecessarily. Close the XfceRc file properly
	  at the end of the function.

2007-01-14	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.{c,h}: Add frap_menu_get_items() method as a convenience 
	  wrapper around frap_menu_item_pool_foreach. Thanks to Benny again.

2007-01-14	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.{c,h}, frap-menu-rules.h, frap-menu-standard-rules.h,
	frap-menu-{standard,or,and,not}-rules.{c}, tests/test-root-menu.c,
	tests/test-display-root-menu.c, Makefile.am, STATUS: Incorporate Benny's
	patch which he wrote for the xfce4-appbrowser mockup. This patch
	includes a lot of changes:

	  - Adds <All> support to all include/exclude rules
	  - Makes parsing include/exclude rules more sane if markup is malformed
	  - Adds kde-applications.menu and gnome-applications.menu to the list
	    of root menu files to search
	  - Adds GError support to menu loading functions
	  - Fixes <DirectoryDir> elements accidently being skipped
	  - Fixes use of g_access usage

	And some other small fixes. Huge thanks to Benny for this.

2007-01-11	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item.{c,h}: Remove "allocated" property and replace it
	  with a kind of reference counter. Add frap_menu_item_ref/unref 
	  methods to be used instead of frap_menu_item_set_allocated() which
	  has been removed. Use "guint ... : 1" notation for boolean values
	  in the structs belonging to FrapMenuItem. 
	* frap-menu-item-pool.c: Call frap_menu_item_ref when adding an item
	  to the pool of a menu (instead of setting the allocated value 
	  directly).
	* frap-menu.c: Use "guint ... : 1" notation for boolean values in
	  structs. Fix frap_menu_set_filename to make free'ing the filename
	  possible. Implement recursive (bottom -> top) collecting of 
	  directory and legacy dirs (might be wrong for legacy dirs, I need 
	  to verify this during the next days). Implement two-pass mechanism 
	  to resolve menu items (in order to be able to handle 
	  <OnlyUnallocated> elements). Only set menu parse state to 
	  _STATE_ROOT if there are no other menus left on the stack.
	* STATUS: Update implementation STATUS.

2006-11-07	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item-pool.c: Fix backwards compatibility by passing 
	  frap_menu_item_pool_remove to the hash table remove loop function 
	  instead of g_object_unref (we need a function returning TRUE here).
	* frap-menu.c: Initial import of legacy menu support by adding
	  frap_menu_resolve_menu, frap_menu_resolve_menus methods. It's not
	  complete yet (only FrapMenu's and FrapMenuDirectory's are created and
	  added to the menu structure; desktop entries are not parsed yet). In
	  addition to this, I added a workaround for distributions not
	  installing KDE properly, by adding $KDEDIR/share/desktop-directories/
	  to <DefaultDirectoryDirs>.
	  Also fixed some segfaults and warnings. 

2006-11-06	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.c, frap-menu-standard-rules.c, frap-menu-item-pool.c, 
	  frap-menu-item-cache.c: Apply patch by Jannis Pohlmann which makes
	  FrapMenu compatible with GLib < 2.12.

2006-11-03	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.{c,h}, frap-menu-move.{c,h}, Makefile.am, STATUS: 
	  frap_menu_get_menu_with_name() added. Implemented <Move>, <New> 
	  and <Old> elements (also added error handling for incomplete move 
	  instructions). A move instruction is a FrapMenuMove with properties 
	  "old" and "new", which refers to the source and target menu names. 
	  
2006-10-31	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Makefile.am, tdb/: tdb added.
	* tests/test-root-menu.c: Return type fixed (EXIT_SUCCESS).
	* frap-menu-item-cache.{c,h}: Prepare for reading cached items from 
	  a tdb. This needs a carefully written memory management 
	  implementation of which I don't know yet how it might look like.
	  Change the signature of frap_menu_item_cache_lookup - the desktop id
	  is now passed as a third parameter. Add a _get_default method, so 
	  other classes can take a reference on the singleton object.
	* frap-menu.c: Make use of the new frap_menu_item_cache_lookup method.
	  Update FrapMenu to keep a reference on the frap menu item cache.

2006-10-15	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item-pool.c: Fix item filter method in order to respect the
	  order of <Include>/<Exclude> elements.
	* frap-menu.c: Rename methods related to FrapMenuParseInfo. Don't load
	  the menu in frap_menu_set_filename (). Instead, just set the filename
	  and use the frap_menu_new (const gchar*) method to actually load the
	  menu file. A method to react on filename changes may be added later,
	  when I'm working on the filesystem monitor.
	  Merge submenus with the same name and consolidate app and directory
	  dirs. This is another step towards proper merging of menus according
	  to the spec and it increases the parsing speed.

2006-10-04	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* tests/test-display-root-menu.c: Add option to load a different menu 
	  than the default applications menu.

2006-10-04	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item.c: Revert parts of the previous commit because of 
	  useless checks.
	* frap-menu.c: Remove <Deleted /> menus and add notes for other 
	  merge actions to be implemented.

2006-10-04	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item.c: Make property assignment more clean.

2006-10-04	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.c: Err, this fixes the <OnlyUnallocated /> check when
	  resolving items.

2006-10-04	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-item-pool.c: Add frap_menu_item_pool_get_empty function.
	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/test-display-root-menu.c: Link against
	  libxfcegui4. Do not display empty menus. Improve icon loading again
	  and execute item command when menu items are clicked.
	* frap-menu-item.c: Leave Exec/TryExec command as is (do not modify the
	  url(s)/file(s) parameter. 
	* frap-menu.c: Respect <OnlyUnallocated /> item when resolve menu items.

2006-10-03	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* STATUS: Updated the implementation status.
	* tests/test-display-root-menu.c: Improved loading / displaying of
	  application icons. It's still not perfect, but much better than
	  before.

2006-10-01	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu-or-rules.c, frap-menu-and-rules.c, frap-menu-not-rules.c:
	  Improve match functions and implement desktop file id matching.
	* Fix several compiler warnings in some of the files.

2006-09-30	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* STATUS: Status updated.

2006-09-30	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.h, frap-menu.c: Make get_rules and add_rule static methods 
	  in frap-menu.c. Implemented parsing of all include/exclude rule
	  elements. get_app_dirs returns all application directories from the
	  bottom up to the root menu now. Added methods to resolve the items of
	  a menu. This is at the moment done by 1) including all items into
	  the pool by scanning the app dirs recursively and 2) removing them
	  according to the include/exclude rules afterwards. 
	* frap-menu-or-rules.c, frap-menu-and-rules.c, frap-menu-not-rules.c,
	  frap-menu-rules.{c,h}, frap-menu-standard-rules.{c,h}: Fix and improve
	  the rules classes. The "include" interface still needs to be moved
	  into FrapMenuRules - Jannis, don't forget about it.
	* frap-menu-item-pool.{c,h}: Implemented several insert, lookup and
	  foreach methods as well as methods for applying the include/exclude
	  rules to the item pool.
	* tests/test-display-root-menu.c: Displays menu items now.
	* frap-menu-item.{c,h}: Added "desktop-id" and "allocated" properties.
	  Free private data in finalize. Don't parse/load MIME types.
	* Makefile.am, frap-menu-item-cache.{c,h}: Cache for menu items added. 
	  This cache currently does not save anything on your harddrives. It 
	  just seaches for an absolute menu item path in a hash table and if 
	  it doesn't exist, it reads the file, creates a menu item, adds it to 
	  the hash table and passes it to the menu asking for it. That's it. 
	  tdb stuff will be implemented later.

2006-09-28	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Makefile.am, frap-menu-not-rules.{c,h}, frap-menu.c: FrapMenuNotRules 
	  for handling <Not> elements implemented.
	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/test-not-rules.c: Test program for the 
	  <Not> rules added.

2006-09-28	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Makefile.am, frap-menu-and-rules.{c,h}, frap-menu.c: FrapMenuAndRules 
	  for handling <And> elements implemented.
	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/test-and-rules.c: Test program for the 
	  <And> rules added.

2006-09-28	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/test-or-rules.c,
	  tests/test-display-root-menu.c: Added two additional test programs,
	  one for testing <Or> rules and one for displaying the root menu.
	* frap-menu-rules.{c,h}: Make methods for adding rules to a
	  FrapMenuRules object public. Add G_TYPE_OBJECT prerequisite to the 
	  FrapMenuRules interface.
	* frap-menu-standard-rules.{c,h}: Add "include" property. This will
	  probably be moved to the FrapMenuRules interface later. Fix abstract
	  ->match method.
	* frap-menu-or-rules.{c,h}: Add frap_menu_or_rules_new method. Make
	  FrapMenuOrRules a FRAP_TYPE_MENU_STANDARD_RULES type. Implement match
	  method (does not yet check the desktop file id, because it's not clear
	  how that is going to be handled).
	* frap-menu-item.c: Implement frap_menu_item_add_categories method.
	* frap-menu.c: Implement parsing of <Include>, <Exclude>, <Or>,
	  <Filename> and <Category> elements. <And> and <Not> are still missing.

2006-09-28	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: Update desktop entry filename. I'm using 
	  xfmedia.desktop as it provides everything I need to test (positively).

2006-09-27	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* frap-menu.{c,h}: Add frap_menu_new method to create a menu structure
	  from a filename.
	* frap-menu-item.{c,h}: Implement first parts of the FrapMenuItem class.
	  This class acts as a wrapper for .desktop entries and represents one
	  application/command.
	* frap-menu-item-pool.{c,h}: First code for FrapMenuItemPool added.
	  Please note that this class has no real use yet. It will probably act
	  as a (Desktop-File Id => FrapMenuItem) mapping. Every menu will have
	  such a pool and whenever the menu needs to access it's menu items, the
	  pool will be queried. The pool itself doesn't store the
	  FrapMenuItem's. They will be kept in cached FrapMenuItemDatabase and
	  be shared among all pools.
	* tests/, test/data/, tests/test-root-menu.c, tests/test-menu-item.c, 
	  tests/Makefile.am, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/xfmedia.desktop:
	  Test environment added. All programs in this directory will test small
	  parts of the menu framework. The first two (one for testing
	  FrapMenuItem and one for loading the root menu) were also added.
	* libfrapmenu.h: Missing headers added.
	* frap-menu-standard-rules.c: This one is currently broken. I'll
	  implement the properties tomorrow.

2006-09-26	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Makefile.am, frap-menu-rules.{c.h}: FrapMenuRulesIface interface added.
	  This interface will be used for the <And>, <Or> and <Not> elements.
	  It provides virtual methods to add filename and category rules as
	  well as FrapMenuRules objects (as the mentioned elements may be
	  nested). It also provides a virtual method for matching menu items
	  (essentially, desktop entries) against these rules.
	* Makefile.am, frap-menu-standard-rules.{c,h}: Implemented a base
	  class for all rule sets (<And>, <Or>, <Not>). It implements the add
	  methods of FrapMenuRulesIface. The responsibility of implementing the
	  match method is forwarded to subclasses of FrapMenuStandardRules.
	* Makefile.am, frap-menu-or-rules.{c,h}: This first implementation of
	  the FrapMenuRulesIface will be used for matching items against <Or>,
	  <Include> and <Exclude> elements. The match method is not implemented
	  yet, though.

2006-07-28	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Import as libfrapmenu into the newly created libfrap development
	  library. Makefile.am probably still needs some tweaking and I need to
	  figure out how to link test programs in libfrap/ to this library, but
	  apart from that, everything has been renamed and should work.

2006-07-27	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* STATUS: Implementation status updated. Directory names are now 
	  resolved properly (and in reverse order).

2006-07-27	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* tests/display-menu.c: Removed debug statement and tooltips allocation.
	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu.c: Use list for possible directory names and
	  try to load them in reverse order when resolving the menu directory of
	  an XfceMenu object. Free string lists properly.

2006-07-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* STATUS: Detailled information about the implementation status added.

2006-07-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu.c: Destroy the menu parse info in
	  xfce_menu_finalize, not directly after parsing the menu. Free
	  old parse info directory name when the menu directory name has 
	  changed and the menu is parsed again. 
	* tests/CMakeLists.txt, tests/display-menu.c: Added a test program to
	  display the menu structure. At the moment, it only contains menus
	  listed in the root menu file, no merged menus or menu items (as
	  these features have not been implemented yet).

2006-07-20	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu-directory.{c,h}: Remove the
	  xfce_menu_directory_lookup method, as the lookup is performed by the
	  menu by using its search paths.
	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu.{c,h}: Recursively resolve menu directories
	  after the parsing process. xfce_menu_get_parent method added.
	* tests/load-root-menu-test.c: Print menu directory information.

2006-07-17	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* tests/load-root-menu.c: Cleanup the test program. Print legacy
	  and app dirs.

2006-07-17	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu.{c,h}: Implement recursive <Menu> parsing.
	  There is no support for merging menus across files and also, 
	  directory and desktop entry lookup is still missing.
	* tests/load-root-menu.c: Extend test program to print the complete
	  menu hierarchy.

2006-07-17	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4menu/xfce-menu.{c,h}: Implemented the following elements:
	  elements: <DirectoryDir>, <DefaultDirectoryDirs>, 
	  <OnlyUnallocated>, <NotOnlyUnallocated>, <Deleted>, <NotDeleted>.
	  
	  Handle <Directory> differently, as we need to parse the whole menu
	  before we can lookup the directory file - therefor XfceMenuParseInfo
	  has been added, which will be used to store temporary information
	  in order to resolve things after parsing the menu.
	  
	  Abort setting properties if new values are equal to the old ones.
	* tests/load-root-menu-test.c: Display only_unallocated, delete and
	  directory_dirs information.
