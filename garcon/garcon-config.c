 * would pass in the constants #GARCON_MAJOR_VERSION,
 * #GARCON_MINOR_VERSION and #GARCON_MICRO_VERSION as the three

 * in use is compatible with the version of

 * <title>Checking the runtime version of the garcon library</title>
 * <programlisting>

 * Returns: %NULL if the library is compatible with the given version,
 *          or a string describing the version mismatch. The returned
 *          string is owned by the library and must not be freed or
